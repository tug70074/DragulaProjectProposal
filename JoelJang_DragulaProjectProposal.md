# Dragula

## Project Abstract
Dragula is a javascript project that allows items in a container to be drag and dropped into another container.  
It is a simple project that was last updated 4 years ago and I think a project in a different language and working on a library rather than an application itself would be interesting to work on.  It allows multiple features and has very crisp designs and interaction with the user when dragging. 
I would like to implement some features after learning the code with the class that have not been implemented yet in the source.

To do : UML Graph to be added.

## Project Relevance
This has relevance because it fulfills all three educational goals of our course:

1. To do:  which broader topics are included in this project.

2. Practical Experience - the javascript library is opensource in github so we can get practice on project managament through git version control.  
We will be able to test this our changes to the javascript library but we would first need to find a template website page to test on.

3. Experience working on open source - this was given as a simple beginner open source project in a list of github projects.  In my opinion, this is a very
simple and good start to getting exposed to working with open source projects and implementing new features.  


## Conceptual Design
So after looking at the demo and seeing the many different features such as removing items from a list, restricting items to be removed, etc. I realized that there wasn't a feature for draging items to another container but filtering out duplicates.
Although it's a simple proposal and feature to implement, I think learning the ins and outs of the project and implementing this feature would be interesting for a week project.
Another potential feature that I could see is combining the content by dragging an item on top of the other so that the text content comes together.  
Also I have not seen an example of showcasing another container more than two.  I wonder if we could add that feature and possibly make it so that it has a different pallete of colors.
